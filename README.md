Summary
This project explores how the stoichiometry of silver sulfide (Ag2S) thin films, produced via reactive sputtering, depends on hydrogen sulfide (H2S) flow and substrate heating. The motivation stems from Ag₂S's use in memristors—resistive switching devices that form the basis of energy-efficient neuromorphic computing hardware.

To characterize the chemical composition and bonding in the films, we use Hard X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (HAXPES), analyzing core-level peaks of silver (Ag 3d) and sulfur (S 2p). Voigt profile fitting and numerical integration allow us to estimate the Ag-to-S ratio in each sample relative to a known Ag₂S reference.

We find that:

For H₂S flows ≥15 sccm, the films approach stoichiometric Ag₂S (Ag:S ≈ 2:1), consistent with optimal memristor conditions.

Substrate heating (160 °C) slightly improves sulfur incorporation and the fraction of chemically bound sulfur.

Low H₂S flow samples (0–2 sccm) show anomalously high sulfur levels due to contamination from earlier sputtering runs.

Ag 3d peaks do not exhibit visible splitting between Ag–Ag and Ag–S environments, likely due to spectral overlap and limited resolution.

These findings highlight the importance of both gas flow control and substrate heating in fabricating functional Ag₂S memristors. Future work should focus on sputtering chamber conditioning, improved spectral resolution, and complementary characterization techniques to resolve silver bonding environments more clearly.# Master-Project-Hard-X-RAY-Photoelectron-Spectroscopy
